# Notice üì¢
This theme is no longer supported. The problem is Vue3 would not work and Vue2 is deprecated.
If you still want a blogger theme that works, try [OP Blogger Theme](https://github.com/opdev1004/op-blogger-themes).
I am not going to use any web app frameworks like vue or react for future blogger theme development.

### Editing Blog Widget in layout page from v0.1.8

Some of section and widget would not show in layout page. Because Blogger's system cannot parse Vue and Vuetify's syntax. There are 2 ways to edit blog post widget. And you probably only need to do this once after install this theme for customization.

1. Move `Blog Widget` script to other Section (Somewhere like `Components` Section) from HTML Edit from Theme page. If you use wrapping arrow on the left side line number bar of HTML edit, you can easily copy and paste block of tag. Then you can edit `Blog Widget` from your layout page. Once you are done, you can copy that back to where it was.

```
<b:section class='Blog' id='Blog' name='Blog' showaddelement='no'>
<b:widget id='Blog1' locked='true' title='Blog Posts' type='Blog' version='2' visible='true'>
... more code
</b:widget>
</b:section>
```

2. Edit manually from HTML Edit. I don't recommend this.

### How to use code style in the post

1. `<pre><code></code></pre>`
